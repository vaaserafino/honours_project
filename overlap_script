To understand more deeply how the pybedtools intersect tool works, take a look at this website:
https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/intersect.html

# Preliminary step to determine which m6A motifs overlap with genes (or gene features)

import pybedtools
a = pybedtools.BedTool('araport11genes.gtf')
b = pybedtools.BedTool('nanopore_m6a_motifs.gtf')
c = a.intersect(b, v=True, s=True) # v=TRUE meaning b features that do not overlap with a features will be written in the output file, s=TRUE meaning features need to be on the same strand to be considered overlapping
c.saveas('significant_m6As.gtf')

#To obtain the list of genes associated with m6A motifs

import pybedtools
a = pybedtools.BedTool('araport11genes.gtf')
b = pybedtools.BedTool('significant_m6A.gtf')
c = a.intersect(b, wa=True, s=True) # wa=TRUE meaning overlapping features will be written in the output file as found in the a feature file and s=TRUE stands for same strandedness only (as in previous code)
c.saveas('gene_with_m6As.gtf')


#To obtain the list of genes not associated with m6A motifs

import pybedtools
a = pybedtools.BedTool('araport11genes.gtf')
b = pybedtools.BedTool('significant_m6A.gtf')
c = a.intersect(b, v=True, s=True)
c.saveas('gene_without_m6A.gtf')
