# Integration of mRNA processing with RNA methylation in *Arabidopsis thaliana* 

This GitHub was created to make available each of the scripts I produced and ran during the course of my Honours Project.

All preleminary steps to obtain the 'm6A_motifs.gtf' mentioned in the Overlap script were generated by the Simpson Lab (link to their website below).

Any additional information needed about the preliminary steps can be found in the following pre-print:

Some formatting steps were conducted via UNIX commands.

Any question concerning my work on this project will be adressed via email:
